              <p>
                You may have seen us recently start two new routes from
                Kigali to the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and
                now Doha in Qatar. We are also operating a new
                twice-weekly service to Lubumbashi, the DRC’s mining
                capital, and another to Goma - capital of North Kivu
                province. Our new Doha route operates three weekly
                flights you can take advantage of our three month offer
                of fares from £550. The new route comes just in time for
                the FIFA 2022 World Cup in Qatar in November, providing
                the perfect opportunity to enjoy one of the new direct
                flights. The new routes can be booked directly through
                rwandair.com. Charter flights for the new route can be
                booked via travel agents or directly by emailing
                charters@rwandair.com. We’re always looking to expand
                our route network and offer our customers even more
                choice and flexibility when it comes to flying with
                RwandAir and 2022 will be no exception, we have a
                European hotspot in the pipeline which we’ll be
                revealing soon
